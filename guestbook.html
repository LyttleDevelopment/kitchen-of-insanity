                                At the end of the 1970's I joined the then 18 year-old Paul De Borger<br>

                                Halfway through his show, Paul began a striptease. Great upheavel<br>
                                and panic amongst the vicar and his believers.<br>
                                At the point where Paul started on his underwear, the vicar<br>
                                shut down the electricity; gone were lights and music.<br>
                                Hilarity was in the air as Paul decided to leave the room in his knickers.

                                to my mind and ears&nbsp;the Kitchen of Insanity ranks among<br>
                                Belgium's finest: Burning Plague, Irish Coffee, dEUS...

                                Surfin' to the Kitchen's site brought back plenty of good memories from days long gone.<br>
                                Often met Paul and Frank in W.G.'s Soundgarden record shop enjoying good music and<br>
                                the occasional drink, or two, three... A lot of the heavy fans at their gigs were also Soundgarden regulars.<br>
                                At Kitchen gigs there was always something more than just good music and enthusiast performing: real "ambiance".<br>
                                One would almost forget Paul's strong lyrics... ... that were days to be loved.

                                I was guided to your site by your "Jackie, once young and crazy". He describes<br>
                                their sound as "musical poetry". I have to completely agree.

                                Heavenly albums. Fantastic concerts. I never quite understood why it all had to end.<br>
                                Anyway , it's great to see that they are still alive and well&nbsp;on the internet<br>
                                and of course in the minds of numerous fans.
