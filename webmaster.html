                            Myself & my story explained...<br>
                            As a child, I was
                            turned on to the likes of <span class="yellow"><em>The Doors</em></span> and many of their contemporaries, like <em>The Rolling Stones</em>,<br>
                            <em>The Who</em>, <em>Jimi Hendrix</em> and <em>John Lennon</em>. But it was the band fronted by <span class="yellow"><em>Jim Morrison</em></span> that would forever be my<br>
                            number one - the subject itself turning into an expertise over the many years of listening, reading and collecting.
                        </p>
                        <p class="gray">
                            In the early 1990's my father send me out to the record store one day to track down the latest cd by a band<br>
                            called <span class="yellow"><em>Kitchen of Insanity</em></span> - he caught one of their songs on the radio and got struck by it. From that moment on,<br>
                            after having absorbed <span class="yellow"><em>Orpheus Feeling</em></span>, <em>The Doors</em>found themselves in the company of some serious<br>
                            competition as far as my own taste in music would go.
                        </p>
                        <p class="gray">
                            Along the line, the likes of <em>Led Zeppelin</em>, <em>R.E.M.</em>,<em>Pearl Jam</em>, <em>Smashing Pumpkins</em>, <em>Live</em>,<em>Neil Young</em>, <em>The Sands</em>,<br>
                            <em>Dire Straits</em> and many, many others would forever earn themselves a place in my heart. But none were like<br>
                            <em>The Kitchen</em> and in particular their <em>Orpheus Feeling</em>, the album that will never leave the Top 3 of my all time<br>
                            favourite albums.
                        </p>
                        <p class="gray">
                            But very little was to be found once 1993 had turned into 1994 and it seemed as if though the band and its<br>
                            individual members had been wiped off the face of this Earth. Even after many years of browsing and<br>
                            searching the Internet, only a few words came up.
                        </p>
                        <p class="gray">
                            In November of 2005, I had a chance meeting with the band's one-time manager. Upon revealing to him my<br>
                            intentions to one day make a <em>Kitchen of Insanity</em> website, <em>Ludwig</em> pointed me into the direction of the band.<br>
                            To my great surprise, the guys were still befriended, living only a couple of miles away from me... I was<br>
                            delighted to find them being very enthousiastic about my plans to construct them a well deserved tribute.
                        </p>
                        <p class="gray">
                            Well, that's me. I hope you will enjoy this website, the stories, the music, the videos and so on.<br>
                            Although unknown to most people, <em>Kitchen of Insanity</em>is a true musical legend, one of the greatest losses<br>
                            in popular music. It is my wish and goal to preserve as much as I can of all this.µ
