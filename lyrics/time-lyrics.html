            This mini CD was released after the debut album, <span class="white"><em>Dreamaway Sunday</em></span>.<br>
            Besides the single <span class="white"><em>Time</em></span>, and remixes of two further tracks from the first album,<br>
            the CD contains two more songs: <span class="white"><em>Come Along</em></span> and <span class="white"><em>All The Things</em></span>, two of the band's primal professional recordings.<br>
            Although both are great songs in their own right, they don't entirely meet the high standards of the album, admittedly in terms of lyrics.
